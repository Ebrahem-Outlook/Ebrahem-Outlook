I'm a software engineer specializing in backend development and distributed systems. I have extensive experience in designing and implementing resilient, responsive, scalable, and maintainable systems using C# and the .NET ecosystem. My expertise includes modular monoliths, microservices, system design, software architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), event sourcing, design patterns, CQRS, DevOps, and problem-solving. I am skilled in unit testing, integration testing, architecture testing, and CI/CD. Passionate about learning, sharing knowledge, and tackling challenges, I am also an open-source enthusiast.
